#Java RMI

This is an example program using Java RMI.

To run the program first compile the code with:

```bash
javac *.java
```

Then to run the RMI server first open a new terminal and enter:

```bash
rmiregistry
```

Then run:

```bash
java LogParser
```

To run the client run:

We hope this example will help you to implement your own RMI program
